# FAT16 File System Reader

This project aims to build a file container parser for **FAT16** file systems. The scope of the project is limited
to input operations only.

A set of API functions was prepared to implement the following functionalities:

* Opening, reading, and closing a block device (in the form of a file).
* Opening and closing a **FAT16** volume.
* Opening, searching, reading, and closing files in the FAT system.
* Opening, reading, and closing directories.
